### NOTES -  to be discussed with Francesca
* Section 2 will has been extended: there is more space for exercises and interaction with students. I think this is really needed. the test database is the classic movement database. The idea is to limit the topics but add a lot of exercises to be sure that students learn what we teach.
* Section 3 is new and is mainly a practical section: given a real dataset, explore it, clean it, import it into a database. With a recap exercise based on another file to be processed. In my opinion this is the most interesting part for most of the students.
* Section 4 in the very first summer school was "the" course, but I think is more effective now, at the end of a longer path. At the stage students are supposed to have the tools to understand all the steps.
* I also removed R from the program. In my opinion it makes sense, but in case you want, we can reintroduce a module of two hours (to be confirmed).
* Flash talks section has to be confirmed. No problem for me, I do not remember if during last summer school it was successful or not.
* All special topics have been removed to save time and keep the whole organization simpler. We could optionally keep Anne Berger if she wants to stay, but it has to be at the end (Friday?) so Anne should stay the whole week for one hour lesson.  

The goal is that at the end of the course students can use a complex movement ecology database, can process and import simple ecological datasets and have seen how to create a complex animal movement database.

I will need some support to:  
1. help students during the exercises  
2. do some of the modules (or at least the practical part of some of them, so I can rest a bit...)  

We need someone that is really familiar with database. For example, in my opinion Federico and Paola are ok for 1) but not for 2).  
It is also good if someone can test all the exercises before the course (if the code works but also if they are clear). Paola, maybe.  
Best for me is Paola as general support plus someone experienced with DB to teach some of the modules, if possible. Otherwise two assistants (Paola + 1) are ok.  

Other question: is the course paid by Eurodeer, by IRSAE or by Aveiro University?
