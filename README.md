#### NOTES -  to be discussed with Francesca
* Section 3 is new and is mainly a practical section: given a real dataset, explore it, clean it, import it into a database. with a recap exercise based on another file to be processed. In my opinion this is the most interesting part for most of the students.
* I also removed R from the program. In my opinion it makes sense, but in case we can reintroduce a module of two hours, to be confirmed.
* Flash talks section has to be confirmed. No problem for me, I do not remember if during last summer school was successful or not.
* All special topics are removed to save time and keep the whole organization simpler. We could optionally keep Anne Berger if she wants to stay, but it has to be at the end (Friday?) so Anne should stay the whole week for one hour lesson.

The idea is to limit the topics but add a lot of exercises to be sure that students learn what we teach.  
The goal is that at the end of the course they can use a complex movement ecology database, can process and import simple ecological datasets and have seen how to create a complex animal movement database. If students are very advanced, we can aim at teaching how to create a complex database on their own.  

I will need some support to:  

1. help students during the exercises  
2. do some of the modules (if possible)  

Someone that is really familiar with database. For example, in my opinion Federico and Paola are ok for 1) but not for 2).

Other question: is the course paid by Eurodeer, by IRSAE or by Aveiro University?
